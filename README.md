# 📊 Sales Analysis of a Single-Unit Product — Case Study

This repository contains my full analysis of a simulated retail dataset focused on the sale of a single product in a large store. The dataset includes the daily trading information for this product and forms the basis of the entire case study.

To complete this case study, I used:
Miro (planning) • Snowflake (SQL coding) • Excel (analysis + visuals) • PowerPoint (final presentation)

## 🎯 Objective of the Case Study
Using the dataset provided (Sales Case Study.csv), I was required to calculate key product performance metrics and derive insights that explain how this product behaves under different pricing conditions.

The key metrics developed include:

Daily sales price per unit
Average unit sales price
Daily % gross profit
Daily % gross profit per unit
Price Elasticity of Demand for three promotional periods

Additional insights based on:

Visuals
KPIs
Trends
Seasonal behaviours
Any interesting patterns observed

## 🔍 Summary of Key Insights
Based on my SQL analysis, Excel work, and visual interpretation:

- The product performs very well at the start of each month, dips mid-month, and rises again toward month-end.
- Weekends drive more sales than weekdays, with Saturday and Friday being the biggest contributors.
- The Autumn season, especially May, is the best-performing period of the year.
- Sales drop sharply when the product is sold above the unit price, resulting in losses.
- Selling below unit price or on promotion leads to better sales performance and lowers losses.
- The cost of producing the product is consistently higher than the revenue, which means the product is running at a loss unless it is priced efficiently.
- There is a negative correlation between selling price and demand when the selling price is above unit price.

## 💡 Recommendations
From the analysis:
- Introduce a promotional matrix to stabilise sales throughout the month.
- Reduce cost of production, as the cost currently outweighs sales revenue.
- Improve marketing efforts in low-performing seasons.
- Optimise forecasting and inventory planning.
- Include the product in combos and specials, as customers respond positively to promotions.
